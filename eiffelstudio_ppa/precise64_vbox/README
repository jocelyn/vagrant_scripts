This vagrant settings is intended to compile EiffelStudio in a Virtual Machine.

It creates an account "eiffel" (password is "eiffel") under /home/eiffel
with 
 - Eiffel 13.11 installed in /home/eiffel/Eiffel_default
 - The source code of EiffelStudio
 - when logged as Eiffel, the environment is setup to use this Eiffel installation.


Howto:

- Install VirtualBox 4.2
- Install vagrant from http://vagrantup.com/

Use vagrant to download and configure everything

  git clone https://github.com/jocelyn/eiffelstudio_vagrant.git 
  cd eiffelstudio_vagrant
  vagrant up

note: you can also checkout using svn, instead of using git
  svn checkout https://github.com/jocelyn/eiffelstudio_vagrant.git/trunk eiffelstudio_vagrant
  
For now, this will configure a linux x64 virtualbox machine, install EiffelStudio 13.11 on it.
Get Eiffelstudio source code, and compile "ec batch" on it.
